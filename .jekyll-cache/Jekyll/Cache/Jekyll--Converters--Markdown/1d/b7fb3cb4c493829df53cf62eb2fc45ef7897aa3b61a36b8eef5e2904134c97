<p>At First, you should add a github workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/build-jekyll.yml) in your repository‚Äôs master branch as below:</p>

<p>To schedule a workflow, you can use the POSIX cron syntax in your workflow file. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes. For example, this workflow is triggered every hour.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 * * * *'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After this, we should provide permissions for this action to push to the gh-pages branch:</p>

<p>Create a Personal Token with repos permissions and copy the value.
Go to your repository‚Äôs Settings and then switch to the Secrets tab.
Create a token named GH_TOKEN (important) using the value copied.
In the end, go to your repository‚Äôs Settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, choose the gh-pages branch as your GitHub Pages source.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you don‚Äôt have the gh-pages branch, you can create it as below:</p>

<p>git checkout ‚Äìorphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
git commit ‚Äìallow-empty -m ‚Äúinitial commit‚Äù
git push origin gh-pages
üí° Tip: The gh-pages branch is only for the site static files and the master branch is for source code.</p>
