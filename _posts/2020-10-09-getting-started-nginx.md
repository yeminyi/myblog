## Introduction
Nginx (pronounced "engine X"), is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.The software was created by Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004. Nginx is free and open-source software. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer.

- Handling of static files, index files and auto-indexing
- Reverse proxy with caching
- Load balancing
- URL rewriting and redirection

## Reverse Proxy
A Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy is an intermediary proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently delivers the serverâ€™s response back to the client. While most common applications are able to run as web server on their own, the Nginx web server is able to provide a number of advanced features such as load balancing, TLS/SSL capabilities and acceleration that most specialized applications lack. By using a Nginx reverse proxy all applications can benefit from these features.
