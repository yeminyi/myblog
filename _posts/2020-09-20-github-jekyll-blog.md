 ```

- To create the branch gh-pages with the files (Github pages will use this branch for the deployment) , run 
 ```Powershell
 git checkout -b gh-pages
 ```
- To commit all the files, run
 ```Powershell
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
 ```
- Push to Github

    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourgithubname/reponame.git
    git push origin gh-pages
 ```

  Before publish to Github ,make sure you updated the file _config.yml ,set the baseurl as your repo name for the blog.
