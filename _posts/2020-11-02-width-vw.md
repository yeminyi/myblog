title: Difference between Width:100% and width:100vw?

vw and vh stand for viewport width and viewport height respectively.

The difference between using  `width: 100vw`  instead of  `width: 100%`  is that while  `100%`  will make the element fit all the space available, the viewport width has a specific measure, in this case the width of the available screen,  **including the document margin**.

If you set the style  `body { margin: 0 }`, 100vw should behave the same as 100%.

### Additional notes

Using  `vw`  as unit for everything in your website, including font sizes and heights, will make it so that the site is always displayed proportionally to the device's screen width regardless of it's resolution. This makes it super easy to ensure your website is displayed properly in both workstation and mobile.

You can set  `font-size: 1vw`  (or whatever size suits your project) in your  `body`  CSS and everything specified in  `rem`  units will automatically scale according to the device screen, so it's easy to port existing projects and even frameworks (such as Bootstrap) to this concept.
